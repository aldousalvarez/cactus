A new CVE came out covering v4.1.x and so\nI needed to upgrade web3 only in those packages where web3 was already above\nv4.0.0 and leave the older ones alone (surgical upgrades).\n\nTo accomplish this I've found no way to do it with stock yarn CLI commands, but\nsomeone who had the exact same problem had written a plugin for solving it.\n\nThe original issue reported to yarn with the same problem we are having:\nhttps://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/issues/2591\n\nThe repository where the plugin resides that we are adding in this commit in\norder to remediate the problem of lack of surgical (per-package) upgrades:\nhttps://github.com/eyolas/yarn-plugin-interractive-filter\n\nThe original CVE that I was investigating as I stumbled upon the solution:\n- https://github.com/hyperledger/cacti/pull/3264\n- https://github.com/hyperledger/cacti/security/dependabot/987\n\nSigned-off-by: Peter Somogyvari <peter.somogyvari@accenture.com>",

          "message": "docs(RELEASE_MANAGEMENT): explain auto-merge for release PRs is a no-no\n\nThe detailed explanation is here:\n\nDo not enable auto-merging on GitHub for the pull request doing the release.\nThe problem with auto-merging here is that it would modify the release commit's SHA as the\nrebase would happen on GitHub's servers where your git signing identity is not available to use\ngiven that GitHub does (should) not have access to your private key for signing.\nThe way the preserve your commit signature as valid the commit SHA must remain the same and the\nway to achieve this is to perform the pull request merging with fast forward. The merging\nensures that there is no commit SHA change and the `--ff-only` option ensures that there is no\nmerge commit to throw a wrench in the process.\n\nSigned-off-by: Peter Somogyvari <peter.somogyvari@accenture.com>",
