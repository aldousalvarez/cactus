A new CVE came out covering v4.1.x and so\nI needed to upgrade web3 only in those packages where web3 was already above\nv4.0.0 and leave the older ones alone (surgical upgrades).\n\nTo accomplish this I've found no way to do it with stock yarn CLI commands, but\nsomeone who had the exact same problem had written a plugin for solving it.\n\nThe original issue reported to yarn with the same problem we are having:\nhttps://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/issues/2591\n\nThe repository where the plugin resides that we are adding in this commit in\norder to remediate the problem of lack of surgical (per-package) upgrades:\nhttps://github.com/eyolas/yarn-plugin-interractive-filter\n\nThe original CVE that I was investigating as I stumbled upon the solution:\n- https://github.com/hyperledger/cacti/pull/3264\n- https://github.com/hyperledger/cacti/security/dependabot/987\n\nSigned-off-by: Peter Somogyvari <peter.somogyvari@accenture.com>",

The merging\nensures that there is no commit SHA change and the `--ff-only` option ensures that there is no\nmerge commit to throw a wrench in the process.\n\nSigned-off-by: Peter Somogyvari <peter.somogyvari@accenture.com>",

Currently our integration tests depend on pre-published container\nimages to be on the official registry (ghcr.io). This has pros and cons.\nThe pro is that we can pin the tests to a specific ledger version and\nthen have confidence that the test code works with that specific image.\nOn the other hand if the image itself has problems we won't know it until\nafter it was published and then tests were executed with it (unless we\nperform manual testing which is a lot of effrot as it requires the\nmanual modification of the test cases).\n2. In order to gives us the ability to test against the container image\ndefinitions as they are in the current revision of the source code,\nwe are adding here a couple of utility functions to streamline writing\ntest cases that build the container images for themselves as part of the\ntest case.\n\nAn example of how to use it in a test case:\n\n```typescript\nconst imgConnectorJvm = await buildImageConnectorCordaServer({\n    logLevel,\n});\n\n// ...\n\nconnector = new CordaConnectorContainer({\n    logLevel,\n    imageName: imgConnectorJvm.imageName,\n    imageVersion: imgConnectorJvm.imageVersion,\n    envVars: [envVarSpringAppJson],\n});\n\n```\n\nSigned-off-by: Peter Somogyvari <peter.somogyvari@accenture.com>",
